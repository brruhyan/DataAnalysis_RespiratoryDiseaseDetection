## Viral Pneumonia Detection
This project involves deploying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Streamlit to allow users to upload X-ray images, which the model will then analyze to determine the presence of respiratory diseases. The deployment process includes building the CNN model, developing the Streamlit application, and setting up the deployment environment.
