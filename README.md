## Viral Pneumonia Detection
This project involves deploying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using [Streamlit](https://dataanalysisrespiratorydiseasedetection-svywseoj4rmzhzsdzzgjz2.streamlit.app/) to allow users to upload X-ray images, which the model will then analyze to determine the presence of respiratory diseases. The deployment process includes building the CNN model, developing the Streamlit application, and setting up the deployment environment.

## Limitations
The application can only determine either if an X-ray image exhibits signs of VIRAL PNEUMONIA or if it is NORMAL. The application can only take in 150x150px images.
